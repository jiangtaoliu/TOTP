(Fill in your email address for "EMAIL", and the path to your secret gist for "YOUR_ACCOUNT/GIST_ID". Be sure you've double-checked your email address; we will contact you by email.)

Then, make an HTTP POST request to the URL http://hdechallenge-solve.appspot.com/challenge/003/endpoint which contains the JSON string as a body part.

Content-Type: of the request must be "application/json".
The URL is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication, which is explained on Chapter 2 of RFC2617, so you have to provide an Authorization: header field in your POST request
For the "userid" of HTTP Basic Authentication, use the same email address you put in the JSON string.
For the "password", provide an 10-digit time-based one time password conforming to RFC6238 TOTP.

You have to read RFC6238 (and the errata too!) and get a correct one time password by yourself.
TOTP's "Time Step X" is 30 seconds. "T0" is 0.
Use HMAC-SHA-512 for the hash function, instead of the default HMAC-SHA-1.
Token shared secret is the userid followed by ASCII string value "HDECHALLENGE003" (not including double quotations).

For example, if the userid is "ninja@example.com", the token shared secret is "ninja@example.comHDECHALLENGE003".
For example, if the userid is "ninjasamuraisumotorishogun@example.com", the token shared secret is "ninjasamuraisumotorishogun@example.comHDECHALLENGE003"
If your POST request succeeds, the server returns HTTP status code 200.
